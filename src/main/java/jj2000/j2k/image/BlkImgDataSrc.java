/**
 * This interface defines the methods to transfer image data in blocks,
 * without following any particular order (random access). This interface does
 * not define the methods to access the image characteristics, such as width,
 * height, number of components, tiles, etc., or to change the current
 * tile. That is provided by other interfaces such as ImgData.
 *
 * <P>
 * This interface has the notion of a current tile. All data, coordinates
 * and dimensions are always relative to the current tile. If there is only
 * one tile then it is equivalent as having no tiles.
 *
 * <P>
 * A block of requested data may never cross tile boundaries. This should
 * be enforced by the implementing class, or the source of image data.
 *
 * <P>
 * This interface defines the methods that can be used to retrieve image
 * data. Implementing classes need not buffer all the image data, they can ask
 * their source to load the data they need.

     * copy, therefore the returned data should not be modified.
     *
     * <P>
     * The rectangular area to return is specified by the 'ulx', 'uly', 'w'
     * and 'h' members of the 'blk' argument, relative to the current
     * tile. These members are not modified by this method. The 'offset' and
     * 'scanw' of the returned data can be arbitrary. See the 'DataBlk' class.
     *
     * <P>
     * This method, in general, is more efficient than the 'getCompData()'
     * method since it may not copy the data. However if the array of returned
     * data is to be modified by the caller then the other method is probably
     * preferable.
     *
     * <P>
     * If possible, the data in the returned 'DataBlk' should be the
     * internal data itself, instead of a copy, in order to increase the data
     * transfer efficiency. However, this depends on the particular
     * implementation (it may be more convenient to just return a copy of the
     * data). This is the reason why the returned data should not be modified.
     *
     * <P>
     * If the data array in <code>blk</code> is <code>null</code>, then a new one
     * is created if necessary. The implementation of this interface may
     * choose to return the same array or a new one, depending on what is more
     * efficient. Therefore, the data array in <code>blk</code> prior to the
     * method call should not be considered to contain the returned data, a
     * new array may have been created. Instead, get the array from
     * <code>blk</code> after the method has returned.
     *
     * <P>
     * The returned data may have its 'progressive' attribute set. In this
     * case the returned data is only an approximation of the "final" data.
     *
     * @param blk Its coordinates and dimensions specify the area to return,
     * relative to the current tile. Some fields in this object are modified
     * to return the data.
